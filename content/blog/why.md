## The purpose of this website

Sometimes, I feel like I have wasted my time,  the  time keeps passing but still I have nothing to show for
The reason of this website is that, I want this to be a place where
I can put the stuff I build and learn, so then in the future I'm able too look
back and say yeah I did this, this what I have been investing my time.

## Recap of my last projects.

Ok it's not like, I have completely wasted my time these last 3-4 years, I learned English (Still learning), 
Finished the [CS50](https://github.com/KelvinJPS/CS50) course, failed building an app [FocusOne](https://github.com/KelvinJPS/FocusOne-Win-Desktop), previous version the now deprecated [UWP framework](https://github.com/KelvinJPS/todolist-uwp).

It was a desktop app that, where the goal was to help the user focus for a period of time, by letting themto select the helpful apps for the task at hand and blocking everything else, my mistake was to try to build every single todo app feature of the competition, and the project became unmaintanable in terms of design I was not able to fit the other's app design into mine, and coding every time I fixed a bug it made it imposible to me to add more features.

then I did a bunch of toy projects, scripts, and did a bunch of solutions to
coding problems for practice

# The plan forward 

I want to start actually being able to finish more projects, and there is a lot of things that I want to learn,  The plan forward is to start being more detailed in what I want to do from the prokects I built and use this website for accountability
