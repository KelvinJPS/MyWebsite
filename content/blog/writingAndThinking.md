# Writing is a way of thinking

## Language learning

In language learning communities there is always the question of how to learn to think in English, and a way to effectively accomplish it, it's through writing, and I don't mean writing as it's usually done at schools where teacher would ask you to complete writing exercises from textbooks.

I mean writing from your own ideas. (after having immersed on the language)[comprehensible input]() At the beginning you will be  able to write basic ideas, like in my case, I'd write a to do list as you can use one tense, the present one like

- [ ] buy food
- [ ] do laundry 

Also I would just write sentences, or words that I heard/saw while watching or reading content.

I would make reviews, of content watched.
